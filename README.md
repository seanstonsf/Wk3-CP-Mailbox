# Wk3-CP-Mailbox
Wk 3 assignment for iOS for Designers CodePath Class

Hours:

~16 hours this week 

I completed the required steps and some of the optionals and did some extra stuff on my own too!

Optionals:
• Panning Menu with Edge & Pan Gesture with Velocities
• Shake to Undo (only tested on simulator)
• Segmented controller swipes views left and right:
    • this isn't completely perfect, on first click on segment it justs the position. Didn't have a chance to debug yet.
    • I made some quick and dirty assets to make a custom navigation bar so that I could tint the icons and segment controls on click. 
    
    Thanks!
